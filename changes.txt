# Changes Log

## Camera Image Capture & FileProvider Integration
- Added FileProvider entry to AndroidManifest.xml for secure file sharing with camera intent.
- Created res/xml/file_paths.xml to define external-files-path for images.
- Updated image picker logic (ImagePicker.kt) to use FileProvider.getUriForFile for generating content URIs instead of file:// URIs.
- Ensured camera intent uses content:// URI, resolving FileUriExposedException crash.

## ClientCheckoutDialog UI Improvements
- Made the file input box look and behave like an input field.
- Clicking the file input triggers the camera to take a picture.
- After taking a picture, the file name is displayed in the input.
- Logic for camera and file handling is separated into ImagePicker.kt for maintainability and future extension (e.g., compression, progress display).
- The 'No file chosen' text now matches the border color of the input box for visual consistency.

## General
- All changes are compatible with future enhancements, such as image compression and progress/status display. 

## Image Compression Logic & UI Status
- Added ImageCompressor.kt with a suspend function to compress images to less than 200KB, maintaining visual quality.
- Integrated compression logic into the image picker: after capturing an image, compression runs automatically in a coroutine.
- Compression status (Idle, Compressing, Success, Failed) is exposed to the UI and shown in the file input box in ClientCheckoutDialog.
- Status text color changes based on state: blue (idle), orange (compressing), green (success), red (failure).
- Compression logic is modular and ready for future enhancements, such as progress display or upload integration.
